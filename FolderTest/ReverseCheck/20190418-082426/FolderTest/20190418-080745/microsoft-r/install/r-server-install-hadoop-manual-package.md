# <a name="manual-package-installation-microsoft-r-server-for-linux-or-hadoop"></a>Manual package installation (Microsoft R Server for Linux or Hadoop)

An alternative to running the install.sh script at the command line is to manually install each package and component. 

## <a name="syntax"></a>Syntax

With root privilege, you can use a package manager to install each package in the R Server distribution. The following example illustrates the syntax.

  + On RHEL: `rpm -i microsoft-r-open-mro-3.3.x86_64`     
  + On Ubuntu: `apt-get install microsoft-r-open-mro-3.3`  
  + On SUSE: `zypper install microsoft-r-open-mro-3.3`   

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

A manual package installation is similar to an offline installation. As a first step, review the instructions for [offline installation](r-server-install-hadoop-offline.md) for system prerequisites and for downloading and unpacking the distribution.

After you unpack the distribution, you should see packages for RPM and DEB in the /tmp/MRS91Hadoop directory.

## <a name="steps"></a>Steps

1. Log in as root or as a user with super user privileges (`sudo -s`). The following instructions assume user privileges with the sudo override.

2. Use a package manager to verify system repositories are up-to-date:

   + On RHEL use [yum](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/sec-Working_with_Yum_Cache.html): `[root@localhost tmp] $ yum expire-cache`  
   + On Ubuntu use [apt-get](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto): `[root@localhost tmp] $ apt-get autoclean`     

3. Install the .NET Core package from [https://www.microsoft.com/net/core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core). This component is required for machine learning, remote execution, web service deployment, and configuration of web and compute nodes.

4. Install Microsoft R Server packages. You should have the following packages, which should be installed in this order:

    microsoft-r-open-mro-3.3.3.x86_64.rpm   
    microsoft-r-server-packages-9.1.rpm     
    microsoft-r-server-hadoop-9.1.rpm   
    microsoft-r-server-mml-9.1.rpm  
    microsoft-r-server-mlm-9.1.rpm  
    microsoft-r-server-config-rserve-9.1.rpm    
    microsoft-r-server-computenode-9.1.rpm  
    microsoft-r-server-webnode-9.1.rpm  
    microsoft-r-server-adminutil-9.1.rpm    

## <a name="create-folders-and-set-permissions"></a>Create folders and set permissions

A manual or custom installation must create the appropriate folders and set permissions.

**RPM or DEB Installers**

- `/var/RevoShare/` and `hdfs://user/RevoShare` must exist and have folders for each user running Microsoft R Server in Hadoop or Spark.
- `/var/RevoShare/<user>` and `hdfs://user/RevoShare/<user>` must have full permissions (all read, write, and executive permissions for all users).

**Cloudera Parcel Installers**

1. Create `/var/RevoShare/` and `hdfs://user/RevoShare`. Parcels cannot create them for you.
2. Give `/var/RevoShare/<user>` and `hdfs://user/RevoShare/<user>` for each user.
3. Grant full permissions to both `/var/RevoShare/<user>` and `hdfs://user/RevoShare/<user>`.

## <a name="install-additional-packages-on-each-node-using-rxexec"></a>Install additional packages on each node using rxExec

Once you have R Server installed on a node, you can use the `rxExec` function in [RevoScaleR](~/r-reference/revoscaler/revoscaler.md) to install additional packages, including third-party packages from CRAN or another repository. 

For example, to install the `SuppDists` package on all the nodes of your cluster, call `rxExec` as follows:

    rxExec(install.packages, "SuppDists")
    
## <a name="enable-remote-connections-and-analytic-deployment"></a>Enable Remote Connections and Analytic Deployment

The server can be used as-is if you install and use an R IDE on the same box, but to benefit from the deployment and consumption of web services with Microsoft R Server, then you must configure R Server after installation to act as a deployment server and host analytic web services. Possible configurations are a [one-box setup](operationalize-r-server-one-box-config.md) or an [enterprise setup](operationalize-r-server-enterprise-config.md). Doing so also enables remote execution, allowing you to connect to R Server from an R Client workstation and execute code on the server.
